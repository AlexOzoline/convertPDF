# convertPDF
Python program I thought of creating to save time when converting my resume and cover letters to PDF files.  
I regularly use this with no issues to seemlessly convert to pdf while keeping formatting in check.  
Included a version of my resume to test on if you so wish.  
To run the program, navigate to the directory in a terminal window and type:  
python convert_to_pdf.py input.docx  
where 'input.docx' is the filename which should be located in the same directory as the python file.
